A few widgets for Ubersicht for OSX
I didn't create these completely from scratch, but I took existing widgets and tweaked them to my own flavour. The result is a few lightweight, minimal widgets that I hope you'll like too! 

![A quick preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mishalbashir/ubersicht-widgets-customized/master/preview.png)

Place in your widgets folder for Ubersicht to enable.

Please note that the todo.widget requires you to have a file called ToDo.list in your MacintoshHD/Users/*Username* folder!

Thanks, and enjoy! :)
